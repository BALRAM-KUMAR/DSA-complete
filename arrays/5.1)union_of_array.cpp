Example 1:
Input:
n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5}



Solution 1: Using Map
Why not unordered_map?
In unordered_map the keys are stored in random order, while in the map the keys are stored in sorted order (ascending order by default). As we require elements of the union to be in ascending order, using a map is preferable.

We can also use unordered_map, but after finding the union of arr1 and arr2, we need to sort the union vector to get the elements of the union in sorted order.
 code:----
  vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  map < int, int > freq;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq[arr1[i]]++;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    freq[arr2[i]]++;
  for (auto & it: freq)
    Union.push_back(it.first);
  return Union;
}
Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) )
 Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union Vector is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union Vector is not considered}


Solution 2: Using Map
Why not unordered_set?
  code
  
  vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  set < int > s;
  vector < int > Union;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    s.insert(arr1[i]);
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
    s.insert(arr2[i]);
  for (auto & it: s)
    Union.push_back(it);
  return Union;
}

Time Compleixty : O( (m+n)log(m+n) )
  Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union Vector is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union Vector is not considered}
  




Solution 3: Two Pointers method
Time Complexity: O(m+n)
Space Complexity : O(m+n) {If Space of Union Vector is considered} 
O(1) {If Space of union Vector is not considered}

code

vector < int > FindUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m) {
  int i = 0, j = 0; // pointers
  vector < int > Union; // Uninon vector
  while (i < n && j < m) {
    if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) // Case 1 and 2
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i])
        Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
      i++;
    } else // case 3
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr2[j])
        Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  while (i < n) // IF any element left in arr1
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr1[i])
      Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
    i++;
  }
  while (j < m) // If any elements left in arr2
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr2[j])
      Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
    j++;
  }
  return Union;
}

Approach:

Take two pointers let’s say i,j pointing to the 0th index of arr1 and arr2.
Create a empty vector for storing the union of arr1 and arr2.
From solution 2 we know that the union is nothing but the distinct elements in arr1 + arr2 
Let’s traverse the arr1 and arr2 using pointers i and j and insert the distinct elements found into union vector.
While traversing we may encounter three cases.
  1.)arr1[ i ] == arr2[ j ] 
  2.)arr[i]<arr2[j]
  3.)arr1[i]>arr2[j]
